## Current slice

**S8c — the record scales with the campaign** (PR #14). Thresholds across the
achievement array and the scenario goals were authored against the two-hundred
year span; a fifty-year campaign met them with a quarter of the sessions. They
now scale with `endYear` through one helper (`v6Span`/`v6Scale`), and the
requirement is *rendered* from the live number rather than hard-coded in the
prose, so a note never contradicts the test beneath it. Epic is 1.0 by
construction — the denominator is the same `CFG` span the numbers were tuned
against — and the regression gate is that the epic record id set is identical,
id for id, before and after; it is, on all three seeds.

Two defects surfaced on the way and are fixed here. **The closing session was
never banked**: `endTurn`'s end-of-campaign branch was `{ finish(); return; }`,
and the `return` skipped the `v6AfterTurn` on the next line, so nothing earned
on the last session was ever recorded — at any length, since 2024. **The hall
of fame could not be won in fifty years**: its score summed raw cumulative
counters, so a short campaign was structurally excluded from the top of its own
cross-campaign leaderboard.

What it is worth, measured with the fixed instrument: a short campaign closes
at 26% / 18% / 26% of the record across three seeds, against 13% / 10% / 15%
before. Epic is unchanged at 28% / 21% / 31%. Named as **not** verified: the
harness plays first-choice-always and loses government early, so every
conclusion about the twelve transient records and the eight in-government ones
is inference from a floor, not a measure of a competent player's run.

Previously: **S8b — the instrument** (PR #13, merged). `tools/pacing.js` was
recomputing every achievement test against the final state; the game *latches*
its records and the displays read the latched map. The figures published in
PR #10 (short 8%, epic 28%) therefore measured the wrong quantity. The tool now
reports the latched map, the id list, a per-test `threw:` list, and the six
counters that gate eight of the length-sensitive records.

Previously: **S8 — pacing, measured** (PR #10, merged). `tools/pacing.js` plays each length option to
its end year through the real turn loop. Findings: all three lengths **do** reach
their end year, and dispatch density is flat at ~1.6-1.8 per session across all
of them — so the fifty-year option is not denser, it is simply shorter. The
record tells the same story: a short campaign closes having unlocked **3 of 39
achievements (8%)**, against 18-23% for a century and 21-28% for two hundred
years. A retune is reserved to the user; three options are put to them in the
PR. Harness caveat, stated in both: it always takes the first choice on offer,
so it loses government early and never initiates a referendum or a treaty — the
achievement figures are a floor, not a typical player's experience.

Previously: **S7 — onboarding** (PR #9, merged). The setup sheet asks its two real questions with a
line each on what they decide, and folds length, difficulty and the house rules
into one disclosure that names them. Also closes the colour-vision question
flagged in S6b and S6c: `tools/seats.js` now simulates all three dichromacies,
and every pair that collapses is an ADJACENT pair — exactly where S6b put the
aisles and the direct labels. The palette needs no change.

Previously: **S6c — the chart vocabulary** (PR #8, merged). Both line charts rebuilt on one shared
helper: every series now ends in its current value, in its own colour, with
leader lines where the declutter moved a label. Narrow screens open a chart on
the present instead of the oldest session. The two items deferred out of S6a and
S6b are closed here — the turn bar is opaque, and the chamber legend no longer
repeats the seven numbers the direct labels already give.

Previously: **S3 — seeded dice** (PR #7, merged). All 93 `Math.random()` sites route through one
seeded engine whose state rides the save, so a campaign is reproducible from a
seed the player can type at setup and read back in the save dialog. Seven
determinism properties are asserted by `tools/determinism.js`, which found two
real bugs in the implementation — construction-time rolls drawn from the
previous game, and a `var seed` local that hoisted over the campaign seed.

Previously: **S6b — the chamber** (PR #6, merged). The seat map rebuilt to the design rulings:
aisles between blocs, a direct label on every bloc, seats rimmed in the ground
colour, and the two invisible party colours lifted along their own hue (RSF
contrast 1.90 → 2.68 at 0.4° of drift, PNL 1.35 → 2.86 at 7.8°). Seats render
about 75% larger on a desktop. `tools/chamber.js` and `tools/seats.js` make all
of it re-measurable, and both caught real defects in the first draft.

Previously: **S6a — three real tiers** (PR #5, merged). Thirteen width thresholds collapsed to
five, and all five are tier edges: 420, 760/761, 1179/1180. The desktop now
uses the window (21% of a 1500px screen was unused, now 4%), and the tablet
band is a tier with its own layout instead of a narrow desktop wearing half the
phone's chrome. Ten queries deleted as provably dead, five retargeted, one
carried forward — `.gz-cols`, which was the only rule in the sweep doing live
work, and which had left the gazette two-up across 621–760.

Previously: **S2 — chain consolidation** (PR #4, merged). Five dead bodies
deleted after poison-proof (132 lines); five more that a reference scan called
dead were proved to execute at boot and kept, with MAP.md corrected. Dead-body
ratchet 10 → 5, which is now its true floor.

## Slice board

| Slice | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| S0 agreement + tooling | **merged** (#1) | checks/, tools/, docs/, hook, skill, permissions |
| S1 correctness | **merged** (#2) | ratchets moved: strict 7/7, stale bindings 0, orphans 10 |
| S2 chain consolidation | **merged** (#4) | 5 orphans deleted with poison-proofs; 5 'orphans' proved live at boot and kept; ratchet 10→5 (its true floor). Marker/seam consolidation deferred to S6, where the restyle needs the seams |
| S4 look mockups | **done — Ministry Precise chosen** | two rounds (5 directions, then 3+3 runoff) at claude.ai/code/artifact/6f9de079-1c31-4c8c-a2f9-03f018069e57; tokens + type recorded in AGREEMENT.md; finalist screen set (Overview ×2, Drafting Desk, Election Night) on the canvas |
| S5 token foundation | **merged** (#3) | tokens retuned, 7 faces embedded (128 KB measured), no external references, allowlist empty; figures on the tabular mono face |
| S6a three tiers | **merged** (#5) | 13 thresholds → 5, all tier edges; desktop waste 21%→4%; tablet given a real layout; `tools/tiers.js` + `tools/tabs.js` measure it |
| Review fixes | **merged** (#12) | 2 real defects + 6 smaller ones from an adversarial pass; chamber tool now replays awkward seat shapes, determinism gains an 8th property, tab-tour stops counting attempts |
| S8 pacing | **merged** (#10) | measured, not retuned: all lengths reach their end year, density is flat, short closes at 8% of the record; the call is the user's |
| S7 onboarding | **merged** (#9) | two guided questions, the rest behind one disclosure; playtest gains `setup-trimmed`; CVD measured |
| S6c charts | **merged** (#8) | one chart vocabulary, end-value labels, charts open on the present; region tiles carry their winner as an edge |
| S3 seeded PRNG | **merged** (#7) | one engine, state on the save, seed typed at setup and shown in the save dialog; `tools/determinism.js` asserts 7 properties |
| S6b the chamber | **merged** (#6) | aisles, direct labels, ground rim, two hue-locked lifts, seats +75% on desktop; `tools/chamber.js` + `tools/seats.js` |
| S8b the instrument | **merged** (#13) | pacing tool read the latched map instead of recomputing; the PR states plainly that PR #10's published figures measured the wrong quantity |
| S8c the record scales | **in review (PR #14)** | thresholds scale with `endYear`, requirements rendered not hard-coded; closing session now banked; hall score made span-relative; epic byte-identical |

## Open items / environment facts

- **Artifact localStorage probe:** published (build B live) at
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/096870e0-8c13-4ab7-a09c-2d7e1422d67d — the
  page renders its own verdict. Build B went live with S1: if the owner visited
  during build A, one more visit settles it — the box turns green (storage
  survived) or the ledger resets (it didn't). Until CONFIRMED,
  Artifact builds of the game are look-and-feel only — phone save-persistence
  unproven there.
- **WebKit in cloud sessions:** blocked by the environment's network policy
  (403 on cdn.playwright.dev and its mirror). The harness auto-uses WebKit
  wherever `npx playwright install webkit` works; adding those hosts to the
  environment allowlist would enable engine-true phone runs here. Substitute
  meanwhile: Chromium at the phone viewport (named SKIP in harness output).
- Checks baselines (`checks/baseline.json`): strict 7/7 and stale bindings 0
  (S1 targets reached and pinned), dead sites max 10 (0 by end of S2),
  unseeded randomness pinned at 1 call (rand()'s pre-game fallback; was 93
  before S3), width thresholds pinned to the five tier edges, size cap 1.6 MB (file now 1.41 MB
  with fonts embedded), external allowlist **empty and staying empty**.
- Both items deferred out of S6a and S6b are closed in S6c: the turn bar is
  opaque at its top edge, and above the phone tier the chamber legend drops the
  seat counts the direct labels already carry (it keeps the party names and the
  banned state, which are never redundant).
- The user's decisions of record live in docs/AGREEMENT.md (interview verbatim).
