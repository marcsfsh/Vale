## Current slice

**S3 — seeded dice** (PR #7). All 93 `Math.random()` sites route through one
seeded engine whose state rides the save, so a campaign is reproducible from a
seed the player can type at setup and read back in the save dialog. Seven
determinism properties are asserted by `tools/determinism.js`, which found two
real bugs in the implementation — construction-time rolls drawn from the
previous game, and a `var seed` local that hoisted over the campaign seed.

Previously: **S6b — the chamber** (PR #6, merged). The seat map rebuilt to the design rulings:
aisles between blocs, a direct label on every bloc, seats rimmed in the ground
colour, and the two invisible party colours lifted along their own hue (RSF
contrast 1.90 → 2.68 at 0.4° of drift, PNL 1.35 → 2.86 at 7.8°). Seats render
about 75% larger on a desktop. `tools/chamber.js` and `tools/seats.js` make all
of it re-measurable, and both caught real defects in the first draft.

Previously: **S6a — three real tiers** (PR #5, merged). Thirteen width thresholds collapsed to
five, and all five are tier edges: 420, 760/761, 1179/1180. The desktop now
uses the window (21% of a 1500px screen was unused, now 4%), and the tablet
band is a tier with its own layout instead of a narrow desktop wearing half the
phone's chrome. Ten queries deleted as provably dead, five retargeted, one
carried forward — `.gz-cols`, which was the only rule in the sweep doing live
work, and which had left the gazette two-up across 621–760.

Previously: **S2 — chain consolidation** (PR #4, merged). Five dead bodies
deleted after poison-proof (132 lines); five more that a reference scan called
dead were proved to execute at boot and kept, with MAP.md corrected. Dead-body
ratchet 10 → 5, which is now its true floor.

## Slice board

| Slice | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| S0 agreement + tooling | **merged** (#1) | checks/, tools/, docs/, hook, skill, permissions |
| S1 correctness | **merged** (#2) | ratchets moved: strict 7/7, stale bindings 0, orphans 10 |
| S2 chain consolidation | **merged** (#4) | 5 orphans deleted with poison-proofs; 5 'orphans' proved live at boot and kept; ratchet 10→5 (its true floor). Marker/seam consolidation deferred to S6, where the restyle needs the seams |
| S4 look mockups | **done — Ministry Precise chosen** | two rounds (5 directions, then 3+3 runoff) at claude.ai/code/artifact/6f9de079-1c31-4c8c-a2f9-03f018069e57; tokens + type recorded in AGREEMENT.md; finalist screen set (Overview ×2, Drafting Desk, Election Night) on the canvas |
| S5 token foundation | **merged** (#3) | tokens retuned, 7 faces embedded (128 KB measured), no external references, allowlist empty; figures on the tabular mono face |
| S6a three tiers | **merged** (#5) | 13 thresholds → 5, all tier edges; desktop waste 21%→4%; tablet given a real layout; `tools/tiers.js` + `tools/tabs.js` measure it |
| S3 seeded PRNG | **in review (PR #7)** | one engine, state on the save, seed typed at setup and shown in the save dialog; `tools/determinism.js` asserts 7 properties |
| S6b the chamber | **merged** (#6) | aisles, direct labels, ground rim, two hue-locked lifts, seats +75% on desktop; `tools/chamber.js` + `tools/seats.js` |
| S6c charts + restyle | next | poll/history polylines, the v8 region grid and the trend chart still wear the pre-refresh chart vocabulary; then the per-surface pass |
| S7 onboarding | pending | setup trim + guided panels |
| S8 pacing honesty | pending | each length option a complete arc; balance changes go to the user first |

## Open items / environment facts

- **Artifact localStorage probe:** published (build B live) at
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/096870e0-8c13-4ab7-a09c-2d7e1422d67d — the
  page renders its own verdict. Build B went live with S1: if the owner visited
  during build A, one more visit settles it — the box turns green (storage
  survived) or the ledger resets (it didn't). Until CONFIRMED,
  Artifact builds of the game are look-and-feel only — phone save-persistence
  unproven there.
- **WebKit in cloud sessions:** blocked by the environment's network policy
  (403 on cdn.playwright.dev and its mirror). The harness auto-uses WebKit
  wherever `npx playwright install webkit` works; adding those hosts to the
  environment allowlist would enable engine-true phone runs here. Substitute
  meanwhile: Chromium at the phone viewport (named SKIP in harness output).
- Checks baselines (`checks/baseline.json`): strict 7/7 and stale bindings 0
  (S1 targets reached and pinned), dead sites max 10 (0 by end of S2),
  unseeded randomness pinned at 1 call (rand()'s pre-game fallback; was 93
  before S3), width thresholds pinned to the five tier edges, size cap 1.6 MB (file now 1.41 MB
  with fonts embedded), external allowlist **empty and staying empty**.
- **Found in S6b, deferred to S6c:** on tablet and desktop the chamber's legend
  now repeats the seven numbers the direct labels already give, within 40px of
  them. The legend stays for now because it also carries each party's banned
  state and is the guaranteed-complete listing when a label is skipped; trimming
  it is a content decision that touches every view calling `legendFor`.
- **Found in S6a, deferred to S6c:** the turn bar's background is 86% opaque at
  its top edge, so page content shows faintly through it on phones.
- The user's decisions of record live in docs/AGREEMENT.md (interview verbatim).
