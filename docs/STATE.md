## Current slice

**S9b — the screen stops jumping** (PR #17). The owner's report — "I click
something and the screen jumps around or resets" — decomposed into nine
mechanisms, each fixed in place:

The window is the scroll container at every tier and same-tab renders had no
scroll handling at all, so the full innerHTML rewrite let the browser clamp
scrollY whenever a view came back shorter; v7's wrapper now saves and restores
around every same-tab render. `flash()` — 74 call sites — scheduled an
unprompted FULL render 1.6 seconds after every "you can't do that" message; it
now restores the hint's own text and nothing else. Seven jump/menu/keyboard
sites forced a smooth scroll-to-top after render, fighting v7's restore with a
double motion (and the phone swipe overrode the restore entirely); v7's
restore is now the single scroll owner. `focus()` without preventScroll at
showSheet/hideSheet/policy-search — long sheets opened pre-scrolled past their
own heading (the old fallback grabbed the first button ANYWHERE in the sheet),
and closing a sheet scrolled to a node the next render destroyed. The phone
nav animated a smooth re-centre on EVERY render (now only when the tab
changed) and the phone stat strip forgot its position (now remembered across
the rewrite). Stat chips changed width when a delta appeared, moving the wrap
point and everything under the cursor (delta slot reserved + min-width ≥761).
The modal toggled body overflow with no scrollbar-gutter, shifting the page
15px on open and close (gutter reserved, scoped ≥761 so the phone keeps its
width). The turnbar ResizeObserver now writes --turnbar-h only on real change.

New playtest step `scroll-keeps`: the pre-fix file fails it on three named
mechanisms (key re-press forced 500→4, flash triggered a delayed render,
gutter auto); the same-tab-render, sheet-open and stats-strip sub-assertions
pass on both files and are regression pins, not proofs — stated here so the
step's evidence is not overread.

Previously: **S9a — nothing is lost quietly** (PR #16, merged). An independent survey after S8d
found a cluster of defects on the one thing the agreement calls the worst
possible failure — the player's record lost silently — and the worst of them
was not the one S8c fixed.

The hall of fame silently destroyed itself: `v8HallRead` caught to `[]` and
`v8HallWrite` caught to nothing, so an unreadable `parliamentVale.hall` blob
read as empty with no warning and the next campaign ending overwrote it — the
one blob a player cannot re-earn. It now has the autosave's S1 contract: an
unreadable blob is reported (in the hall's own render and by toast), left
untouched, and never overwritten; the player's explicit "clear the hall" still
works. A campaign that ended in collapse banked nothing from its dying
session: `checkCollapse`'s two `gameOver` calls fired before any tick — the
same defect class S8c fixed, on the branch S8c did not touch; both endings now
bank first through a shared `v6BankSession` helper. The Record page printed a
raw template: the goal panel was the ONE note read site not going through
`v6Note`, so the default opening showed "Put {n} of your bills on the statute
book". Records and goals could be dated one year after the republic ended
(unclamped `yearOf` at three sites). Smaller truths: `rd_decade` renamed ("A
decade" while requiring `v6Scale(st,12)`), `.goal-mark` finally has a CSS rule
(the percentage was taking the wide grid column), the ending copy no longer
says "the two centuries" on a fifty-year campaign, and the playtest's modal
drain no longer races `v6Pump`'s 40 ms re-open. Every fix ships with the
assertion that would have caught it; all four new steps FAIL against the
pre-fix file.

Previously: **S8d — the flagged leftovers** (PR #15, merged). Four small
items, none a design decision, each carried forward from an earlier slice's
notes.

`breakpoint-tiers` was a membership test wearing a partition test's name, and
five ways past it are now closed with a proof of each: a number used as both a
`min-` and a `max-` edge (so both rules apply at that exact pixel), `em`/`rem`
widths, media-range syntax `(width >= 900px)`, fractional thresholds, and the
one height threshold in the file — `max-height:460px`, the landscape turn bar,
which until now was governed by nothing.

`hemiMap`'s `total` parameter was declared, never read, and promised a
guarantee the body does not make: the arc is drawn from the sum of the seats
object, so a roll short of its chamber's size draws a silently smaller chamber
while every existing assertion still reads "ok". The parameter is gone and the
guarantee is now real — `tools/chamber.js` asserts both houses total their
constitutional size at the opening and after every election. This was the last
open S6 implementation note in AGREEMENT.md bar one, which is marked still
open there rather than quietly dropped.

The campaign-seed copy now says "the same seed and the same **choices, in the
same order**". Only the free tightening was taken: I could not produce a
divergence from choices alone — only from dismissing a sheet versus answering
it — and would not weaken a claim I cannot falsify.

And the board below is corrected twice: PR #12 was still listed as in review,
and S2's note that marker/seam consolidation was **deferred to S6** was
silently dropped when S6a/b/c all merged without it. It is restored as named,
pending work — it is the largest remaining stabilisation item and the next
slice.

Previously: **S8c — the record scales with the campaign** (PR #14, merged).
Thresholds across the achievement array and the scenario goals were authored
against the two-hundred-year span; a fifty-year campaign met them with a
quarter of the sessions. They now scale with `endYear` through one helper, and
the requirement is *rendered* from the live number rather than hard-coded in
the prose. Epic is 1.0 by construction and its record id set is identical, id
for id, before and after. Two defects fixed on the way: the closing session was
never banked (`endTurn`'s end-of-campaign `return` skipped the tick), and the
hall of fame's score summed raw cumulative counters, so a short campaign was
structurally excluded from the top of its own leaderboard. Short closes at
26% / 18% / 26% of the record against 13% / 10% / 15% before; epic unchanged.

Previously: **S8b — the instrument** (PR #13, merged). `tools/pacing.js` was
recomputing every achievement test against the final state; the game *latches*
its records and the displays read the latched map. The figures published in
PR #10 (short 8%, epic 28%) therefore measured the wrong quantity. The tool now
reports the latched map, the id list, a per-test `threw:` list, and the six
counters that gate eight of the length-sensitive records.

Previously: **S8 — pacing, measured** (PR #10, merged). `tools/pacing.js` plays each length option to
its end year through the real turn loop. Findings: all three lengths **do** reach
their end year, and dispatch density is flat at ~1.6-1.8 per session across all
of them — so the fifty-year option is not denser, it is simply shorter. The
record tells the same story: a short campaign closes having unlocked **3 of 39
achievements (8%)**, against 18-23% for a century and 21-28% for two hundred
years. A retune is reserved to the user; three options are put to them in the
PR. Harness caveat, stated in both: it always takes the first choice on offer,
so it loses government early and never initiates a referendum or a treaty — the
achievement figures are a floor, not a typical player's experience.

Previously: **S7 — onboarding** (PR #9, merged). The setup sheet asks its two real questions with a
line each on what they decide, and folds length, difficulty and the house rules
into one disclosure that names them. Also closes the colour-vision question
flagged in S6b and S6c: `tools/seats.js` now simulates all three dichromacies,
and every pair that collapses is an ADJACENT pair — exactly where S6b put the
aisles and the direct labels. The palette needs no change.

Previously: **S6c — the chart vocabulary** (PR #8, merged). Both line charts rebuilt on one shared
helper: every series now ends in its current value, in its own colour, with
leader lines where the declutter moved a label. Narrow screens open a chart on
the present instead of the oldest session. The two items deferred out of S6a and
S6b are closed here — the turn bar is opaque, and the chamber legend no longer
repeats the seven numbers the direct labels already give.

Previously: **S3 — seeded dice** (PR #7, merged). All 93 `Math.random()` sites route through one
seeded engine whose state rides the save, so a campaign is reproducible from a
seed the player can type at setup and read back in the save dialog. Seven
determinism properties are asserted by `tools/determinism.js`, which found two
real bugs in the implementation — construction-time rolls drawn from the
previous game, and a `var seed` local that hoisted over the campaign seed.

Previously: **S6b — the chamber** (PR #6, merged). The seat map rebuilt to the design rulings:
aisles between blocs, a direct label on every bloc, seats rimmed in the ground
colour, and the two invisible party colours lifted along their own hue (RSF
contrast 1.90 → 2.68 at 0.4° of drift, PNL 1.35 → 2.86 at 7.8°). Seats render
about 75% larger on a desktop. `tools/chamber.js` and `tools/seats.js` make all
of it re-measurable, and both caught real defects in the first draft.

Previously: **S6a — three real tiers** (PR #5, merged). Thirteen width thresholds collapsed to
five, and all five are tier edges: 420, 760/761, 1179/1180. The desktop now
uses the window (21% of a 1500px screen was unused, now 4%), and the tablet
band is a tier with its own layout instead of a narrow desktop wearing half the
phone's chrome. Ten queries deleted as provably dead, five retargeted, one
carried forward — `.gz-cols`, which was the only rule in the sweep doing live
work, and which had left the gazette two-up across 621–760.

Previously: **S2 — chain consolidation** (PR #4, merged). Five dead bodies
deleted after poison-proof (132 lines); five more that a reference scan called
dead were proved to execute at boot and kept, with MAP.md corrected. Dead-body
ratchet 10 → 5, which is now its true floor.

| S8 pacing | **merged** (#10) | measured, not retuned: all lengths reach their end year, density is flat; the call is the user's. Its published record shares were wrong — the instrument recomputed instead of reading the latched map (corrected in #13) |
| S7 onboarding | **merged** (#9) | two guided questions, the rest behind one disclosure; playtest gains `setup-trimmed`; CVD measured |
| S6c charts | **merged** (#8) | one chart vocabulary, end-value labels, charts open on the present; region tiles carry their winner as an edge |
| S3 seeded PRNG | **merged** (#7) | one engine, state on the save, seed typed at setup and shown in the save dialog; `tools/determinism.js` asserts 7 properties |
| S6b the chamber | **merged** (#6) | aisles, direct labels, ground rim, two hue-locked lifts, seats +75% on desktop; `tools/chamber.js` + `tools/seats.js` |
| S8b the instrument | **merged** (#13) | pacing tool read the latched map instead of recomputing; the PR states plainly that PR #10's published figures measured the wrong quantity |
| S8c the record scales | **merged** (#14) | thresholds scale with `endYear`, requirements rendered not hard-coded; closing session now banked; hall score made span-relative; epic byte-identical |
| S8d the leftovers | **merged** (#15) | breakpoint check made a partition test (5 proofs); hemiMap's false `total` dropped and the guarantee moved into `tools/chamber.js`; seed copy tightened; this board corrected |
| S9a nothing lost quietly | **merged** (#16) | hall gets the S1 loudness contract; collapse endings bank their session; the one raw `note` read site fixed; year clamps; 4 new playtest steps, each proven to fail pre-fix |
| S9b the screen holds still | **in review (PR #17)** | nine jump mechanisms fixed in place; v7's restore is the single scroll owner; `scroll-keeps` step discriminates on three of them |
| **Marker/seam consolidation** | **pending — next slice** | deferred out of S2 to S6, then silently dropped when S6a/b/c merged without it. 21 literal splice markers; dead-body ratchet 5 → 0. The largest remaining stabilisation item and the user's stated co-priority |

## Open items / environment facts

- **Artifact localStorage probe:** published (build B live) at
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/096870e0-8c13-4ab7-a09c-2d7e1422d67d — the
  page renders its own verdict. Build B went live with S1: if the owner visited
  during build A, one more visit settles it — the box turns green (storage
  survived) or the ledger resets (it didn't). Until CONFIRMED,
  Artifact builds of the game are look-and-feel only — phone save-persistence
  unproven there.
- **WebKit in cloud sessions:** blocked by the environment's network policy
  (403 on cdn.playwright.dev and its mirror). The harness auto-uses WebKit
  wherever `npx playwright install webkit` works; adding those hosts to the
  environment allowlist would enable engine-true phone runs here. Substitute
  meanwhile: Chromium at the phone viewport (named SKIP in harness output).
- Checks baselines (`checks/baseline.json`): strict 7/7 and stale bindings 0
  (S1 targets reached and pinned), dead sites max 10 (0 by end of S2),
  unseeded randomness pinned at 1 call (rand()'s pre-game fallback; was 93
  before S3), width thresholds pinned to the five tier edges and heights to the
  one (460, the landscape turn bar — added in S8d, when the check learned about
  the height axis), size cap 1.6 MB (file now 1.43 MB with fonts embedded),
  external allowlist **empty and staying empty**.
- Both items deferred out of S6a and S6b are closed in S6c: the turn bar is
  opaque at its top edge, and above the phone tier the chamber legend drops the
  seat counts the direct labels already carry (it keeps the party names and the
  banned state, which are never redundant).
- The user's decisions of record live in docs/AGREEMENT.md (interview verbatim).
